# Wireless Payment Channel Network Simulation for OMNET++
Omnet++ simulation of Wireless Payment Channel Networks

## Requirements

Our WPCN implementation uses Python 3 to implement the topology and workload generators. Furthermore, we use the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) to create the network topology and [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/). We assume that you already have Python 3 and pip installed in your computer. To install the necessary requirements, run the following command at the wpcn-omnet directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
